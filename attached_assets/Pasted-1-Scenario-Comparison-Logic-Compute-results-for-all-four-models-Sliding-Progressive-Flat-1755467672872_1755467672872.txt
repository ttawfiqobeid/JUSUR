1. Scenario Comparison:
    * Logic: Compute results for all four models (Sliding, Progressive, Flat, ROI-based) using the same inputs and display them in a dedicated tab with key metrics (Total Profit, Jusur %, Investor Profit, ROI, Your Share). Use a grid layout for side-by-side comparison, with each model in its own card.
    * Why Optimal: Allows quick evaluation of which model maximizes investor or Jusur returns, enhancing decision-making agility. Leverages existing computeResults function to avoid redundant logic.
2. Investment History Tracking:
    * Logic: Store deals in localStorage for offline use, with an option to sync to Firebase Firestore for team-shared access. Display in a “History” tab as a scrollable table with sortable columns (Date, Buy Price, Sell Price, Profit, ROI). Include a “Save Deal” button to capture current inputs/results.
    * Why Optimal: LocalStorage ensures offline functionality and fits free hosting tiers. Firebase can be added later for collaboration without disrupting the core app.
3. Sensitivity Analysis:
    * Logic: Create a “Sensitivity Analysis” tab with a LineChart showing Jusur and investor profits across a range of total profits (50% to 150% of the current profit). Calculate corresponding sell prices to reflect your request for profit dependency on sell price/profit size. Use Recharts for smooth, interactive visualization.
    * Why Optimal: Directly visualizes the dynamic profit split (e.g., higher Jusur % for larger profits in Progressive/Sliding models), making it intuitive and actionable. Client-side computation keeps it lightweight.
4. Break-even Analysis:
    * Logic: Add a user input for target ROI (default 10%) and calculate the minimum sell price needed to achieve it, accounting for commissions, RET Tax, and Other Expenses. Display as a KPI in the Results tab and include in CSV export.
    * Why Optimal: Provides a clear financial target, enhancing the app’s utility for setting sale price goals. Simple formula ensures fast computation.
5. Save/Load Profiles:
    * Logic: Allow users to save named input profiles (e.g., “Property A”) to localStorage. Display a dropdown to load profiles, updating input fields. Include a “Save Profile” button next to the profile name input.
    * Why Optimal: Improves user experience by enabling quick reuse of common deal setups, ideal for teams evaluating multiple properties.
6. Real Estate Transactions Tax (RET Tax):
    * Logic: Add an optionl because some deals does not need me to input for RET Tax percentage (default 2.5%, common in Egypt for real estate). Apply it to the sell or buy price as an additional cost, reducing net sale revenue. Include in calculations and display in the breakdown.
    * Why Optimal: Reflects real-world costs, making the app more accurate. User-configurable percentage accommodates varying tax rates.
7. Other Expenses:
    * Logic: Add an input for a flat “Other Expenses” amount (e.g., legal fees, maintenance) to be subtracted from net sale revenue. Display in the breakdown and include in CSV export.
    * Why Optimal: Captures miscellaneous costs without overcomplicating the app, maintaining flexibility for users.
Implementation Strategy
* Replace Analytics: The Vercel/Netlify analytics section (e.g., bandwidth, page views) is replaced by tabs for Scenario Comparison, Sensitivity Analysis, and History, which are more relevant for financial decision-making.
* Dynamic Profit Relationship: The Sensitivity Analysis tab visualizes how Jusur’s share increases with profit size (e.g., 25% at ≤500K, 45% at >1M in Progressive model), directly addressing your requirement.
* Client-Side Focus: Use localStorage for history and profiles to keep the app lightweight and compatible with Vercel’s free tier. Firebase can be added for team-shared data later.
* UI/UX: Leverage existing Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Framer Motion for a polished, responsive interface. Add touch-friendly inputs and scrollable tables for mobile use.
* CSV Export: Include RET Tax, Other Expenses, and break-even sell price in the export for comprehensive reporting.
