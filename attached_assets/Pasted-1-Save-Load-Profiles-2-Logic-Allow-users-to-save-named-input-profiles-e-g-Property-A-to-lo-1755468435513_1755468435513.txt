1. Save/Load Profiles:
2. Logic: Allow users to save named input profiles (e.g., “Property A”) to localStorage. Display a dropdown to load profiles, updating input fields. Include a “Save Profile” button next to the profile name input.
3. Why Optimal: Improves user experience by enabling quick reuse of common deal setups, ideal for teams evaluating multiple properties.
4. Real Estate Transactions Tax (RET Tax):
5. Logic: Add an input for RET Tax percentage (default 2.5%, common in Egypt for real estate). Apply it to the sell price as an additional cost, reducing net sale revenue. Include in calculations and display in the breakdown.
6. Why Optimal: Reflects real-world costs, making the app more accurate. User-configurable percentage accommodates varying tax rates.
7. Other Expenses:
8. Logic: Add an input for a flat “Other Expenses” amount (e.g., legal fees, maintenance) to be subtracted from net sale revenue. Display in the breakdown and include in CSV export.
9. Why Optimal: Captures miscellaneous costs without overcomplicating the app, maintaining flexibility for users.
10. Implementation Strategy
11. Replace Analytics: The Vercel/Netlify analytics section (e.g., bandwidth, page views) is replaced by tabs for Scenario Comparison, Sensitivity Analysis, and History, which are more relevant for financial decision-making.
12. Dynamic Profit Relationship: The Sensitivity Analysis tab visualizes how Jusur’s share increases with profit size (e.g., 25% at ≤500K, 45% at >1M in Progressive model), directly addressing your requirement.
13. Client-Side Focus: Use localStorage for history and profiles to keep the app lightweight and compatible with Vercel’s free tier. Firebase can be added for team-shared data later.
14. UI/UX: Leverage existing Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Framer Motion for a polished, responsive interface. Add touch-friendly inputs and scrollable tables for mobile use.
15. CSV Export: Include RET Tax, Other Expenses, and break-even sell price in the export for comprehensive reporting. and fix the table exported make it more comprehendebal and add commas and fix the formating
